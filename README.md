# Scripts
Some random utility scripts for daily use.

The scripts are primarily made for myself when I have had a specific need for one. But the scripts are free to use in case someone finds a use case for them.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo to a location you like, e.g. under your home directory:
`git clone https://github.com/onnex/scripts.git ~/scripts`
2. Make sure the scripts are executable: `chmod +x <script>`
3. Optional: Add the directory to your path or symlink the scripts to a directory already existing in the path
